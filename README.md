# REACT Mars App

#### Summary

A web-based app to test Humans before allowing them to travel Mars.

This app integrated the use of the following REACT components:

- Implement *state* and *props* for interactivity
- Create a counter that runs down from a minute and runs at the same time of the test. If the user fails to complete the test push the to the rejected screen.
- Create a quiz using true and false values, caputre the inputs, compare them to an array of questions and answers, send the user to the approved or fail screen.
- If the user fails the quiz resets.

#### Tools Used

- REACT and related props and components
- Use browser history to transition from pages.
- Gulp -- *build tasks, file minification, browser sync, SASS processing, AngularJS processing*
- Git and GitHub
- Javascript
- jQuery
- HTML5/CSS3

#### Reflections

Though I found the learning curve for REACT much higher than AngularJS I enjoyed the modularity of REACT. It was fun to wrap my head around capturing values from one component and utilizing them elsewhere. REACT has an interesting pattern that is very satisfying to work with once you get the hang of it.
